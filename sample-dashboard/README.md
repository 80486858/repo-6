# Ruby On Rails Performance Dashboard

A dashboard providing Ruby on Rails performance insights based on
[Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), ready to
run inside your data-center.

By default it measures (in various forms):

- Controller Action Runtime
- View/Partial Render Runtime
- Database Query Runtime

It provides an overview and you can also drill down into numbers on a per request basis. Of course you can use all the awesome features that Influx (Downsampling/Data Retention), Grafana (Alerts, Annotations) and influxdb-rails (custom tags) provide and extend this to your needs. Use your freedom and run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve this software!

## Requirements

To be able to measure performance you need the following things available:

- [InfluxDB 1.x](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/introduction/installation/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/)
- A [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application with [influxdb-rails](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-rails) enabled

## Installation

Once you have influx/grafana instances running in your infrastructure just [import both
dashboards from grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/export_import/#importing-a-dashboard).

- [Overview Dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/10428)
- [Request Dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/10429)

You can also paste the `.json` files from this repository.

In the unlikely case that you need to change the dashboard *UID*s during import you can configure the *UID* the `Overview` dashboard uses to link to the `Request` dashboard in the [variables](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/#adding-a-variable). Just paste whatever *UID* you've set up for the `Request` dashboard.

## Demo

This repository includes a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) demo setup for influxdb and grafana that you can use with any rails app you already have.

### Starting the demo

Clone this repository and run

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### Configure your Rails app

Follow our [install instructions](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-rails/#installation), the default configuration works with the demo.

To be able to view individual request you have to enable request ID tags in your application. Something like:

```ruby
class ApplicationController

  before_action :set_influx_data

  def set_influx_data
    InfluxDB::Rails.current.values = { request: request.request_id }
  end
end
```

Every request to your rails app will now generate performance data in the demo which you can view at

http://0.0.0.0:8000

## Just show me how it looks sister!

Alternatively you can also just look at how we measure the performance of the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/) instance over
at [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org), that's how this dashboard was born, our numbers are public ðŸ¤
